## Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹
I am glad to see you here. First of all, let me introduce myself. I promote myself as a full-stack JavaScript developer with more than 3 years experience. In addition, I'm also familar with **TypeScript**, **Java** and **Python**. I do a lot of things, but currently I am focused on my main project. My goal is to become a front-end developer and improve my further programming skills.

## Projects I'm working on âœ¨
As I said before, I do not have a lot of projects. I'm working on a huge Discord-bot, which is `[Flame](https://github.com/Flame-Developers/Flame)`.
