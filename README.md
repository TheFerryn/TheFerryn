## Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹
I am glad to see you here. First of all, let me introduce myself. I promote myself as a full-stack JavaScript developer with more than 3 years experience. I do a lot of things, but currently I am focused on my main project. My goal is to become a front-end developer and further improve my programming skills.
